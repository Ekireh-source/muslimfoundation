Establishing an endowment ensures that your values and priorities as a donor are maintained by our organization for perpetuity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since 2009 ISF has awarded $3.06 million to 574 young American Muslims pursuing academic and professional careers in law, human rights, journalism, film, public policy, criminal justice, and more. Our programmatic model is based on a comprehensive Cycle of Support, which begins with scholarships and mentorships and continues with internship and fellowship opportunities, career counseling, and continuing education. Our alumni now work as directors and leaders at major nonprofits and advocacy organizations such as Human Rights Watch, CAIR, and the ACLU; at major media networks such as NBC News, CNN, and Al Jazeera; as officials influencing public policy; as federal clerks in the U.S. District Courts; and in film and journalism, telling critically important stories about Muslim rights and advocating for greater inclusion.<\/p>\n\t<h4><b>&nbsp;WHAT IS A WAQF OR ENDOWMENT?<\/b><\/h4>\n\t<p><b><strong>ISF&#8217;s Sustainers Circle<\/strong> follows Islamic principles of endowments, also known as a <em>Waqf<\/em>. A <em>Waqf<\/em> is a religious endowment that is voluntary, permanent, and irrevocable. <\/b>One dedicates a portion of their wealth, in cash or in-kind (e.g. a house or garden), and its disbursement, for Shariah-compliant projects. Once a <em>Waqf<\/em> is created, it can never be donated as a gift, inherited, or sold.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An endowment is an investment that grows over the long term<\/strong>, where the principal remains intact and the earnings are used for charitable causes. This protects the earning power and enables donors and nonprofit organizations to continuously donate earnings or grow endowments by reinvesting them in the principal.<\/p>\n<p><em>Waqf<\/em> or <em>Sadaqah Jariyah<\/em> is one of the most rewarding acts a person can do in their lifetime. Interestingly, the oldest university in the world, University of Al Quaraouiyine, was created by a <em>Waqf<\/em>, as confirmed by UNESCO and Guinness World Records. The University of Oxford is also modeled after the Islamic <em>Waqf <\/em>system.<\/p>\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/HBEBbQkxNtk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe>\n\t<h4><b>WHY WOULD I ESTABLISH AN ENDOWMENT?<\/b><\/h4>\n\t<p><strong>According to a famous <em>hadith<\/em>, &#8220;When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), a beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.&#8221;<\/strong> The establishment of a Waqf through ISF&#8217;s Sustainers Circle not only creates a continuous charity that brings ongoing contributions to the organization for perpetuity, but also promotes the seeking of beneficial knowledge and a means of ongoing gratitude and <em>duaa<\/em> for our donors.<\/p>\n<p>The following are a few of the many benefits to joining ISF&#8217;s Sustainers Circle and establishing an endowment fund:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/islamicscholarshipfund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/money.png\" alt=\"money\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"297\" width=\"297\" title=\"money\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\">\n\t<p><strong>Establish a Sadaqah Jariyah<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An endowment fund allows you to establish an ongoing charity, a gift that not only benefits the organization, but continues to bring you reward, in this life and the next!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/islamicscholarshipfund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/protect.png\" alt=\"protect\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"297\" width=\"297\" title=\"protect\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\">\n\t<p><strong>Preserve Your Priorities &amp; Values<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An endowment fund ensures that the programs that are important to you will always remain in place, ensuring that your own priorities are sustained in the organization.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/islamicscholarshipfund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/leaf.png\" alt=\"leaf\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"297\" width=\"297\" title=\"leaf\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\">\n\t<p><strong>Sustain ISF for Future Growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your endowment fund creates a safety net that allows the organization to expand and grow while programs that you value are not put at risk due to increased funding needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/islamicscholarshipfund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/infinity.png\" alt=\"infinity\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"297\" width=\"297\" title=\"infinity\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\">\n\t<p><strong>Leave Behind a Lasting Legacy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Donations to endowments survive beyond the lives of their givers, creating a true legacy that will honor your values and preserve your name for generations to come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/islamicscholarshipfund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/moneybag.png\" alt=\"moneybag\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"297\" width=\"297\" title=\"moneybag\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\">\n\t<p><strong>Easy &amp; Intelligent Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An endowment fund allows you to make a meaningful and intelligent investment by contributing to both our programmatic and operational development, without the burden of managing those funds.<\/p>\n\t<h4><b>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?<\/b><\/h4>\n\t<p><strong>Besides the general benefits mentioned above and the tremendous blessing and reward that come with establishing a recurring charity, ISF offers exclusive program benefits to our Sustainers Circle members.
